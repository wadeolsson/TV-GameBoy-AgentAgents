Mole Game — TODO & Project Context
Date: 2026-01-30

Workspace root:
c:\Users\tvhsstudent\Documents\Graham C\MoleGameFork\TV-GameBoy-AgentAgents-Graham

Modules present:
- shared
- launcher
- games/template-game
- (planned) games/mole-game

Build & run notes:
- Gradle wrapper script: gradlew.bat (use from repo root)
- Build launcher (installDist) then run generated launcher script:
  powershell -File .\dev-run.ps1    # starts watcher that rebuilds and restarts on changes

Useful Gradle tasks (examples):
- .\gradlew.bat :launcher:installDist    # builds and creates runnable install under launcher/build/install

Current dev helper:
- `dev-run.ps1` (project root) — watches `*.java`, runs `:launcher:installDist`, then launches
  launcher\build\install\launcher\bin\launcher.bat. It restarts the app automatically on Java file changes.

High-level TODOs (tracked in project todo list):
1) Design & questions
   - Define controls, resolution, tunnel model, worm placement, persistence, and art style.
2) Scaffold module
   - Create `games/mole-game` by copying `games/template-game` skeleton and add `build.gradle`.
3) Add to Gradle settings
   - Update `settings.gradle` to include `:games:mole-game`.
4) Implement player controller
   - Surface walking, jumping, gravity, input mapping (Left/Right, Jump, Dig).
5) Implement digging & tunnels
   - Enter underground on Down from surface, free movement underground, record tunnel path.
6) Tunnel data & rendering
   - Decide grid vs polyline; draw tunnel visuals and handle collisions.
7) Collectibles & scoring
   - Worms placement, pickup, score/UI.
8) Integration into selector
   - Register game in `GameRegistry` and place in selector top-middle slot.
9) Assets & polish
   - Placeholder sprites, animations, sounds, tweak physics.
10) Test & iterate
   - Use `dev-run.ps1` watcher to rebuild/restart while developing.

Verification questions to answer before implementation:
- Preferred control mapping? (default: A/D or ←/→, Space = jump, ↓ = dig)
- Target resolution or window size?
- Tunnel representation preference: grid of dug tiles (simpler) or free polyline (smoother visuals)?
- Worm placement: above ground, underground, or both?
- Persistence: reset tunnels each run or persist across sessions?
- Do you have art assets, or should placeholders be used?
- Add enemies/stamina/limits for digging?

Next action I can take (pick one):
- Scaffold `games/mole-game` module and add basic player movement prototype.
- Or implement tunnel model (grid or polyline) and demo digging visuals.
